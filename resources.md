# Data Structures & Algorithms in Python
## Lesson 1: Introduction and Efficiency
* Efficiency: Time and Space complexity with example of cutting hair
* Notation: Explain O(n) with cipher example, also talk about approximation
* Best case, Average case vs Worst case scenarious with 26 Alphabets.
* **Note:** Anything that can be approximated to O(n) can be said to occur "in linear time". If you plotted n = y on a graph, it would be a line. You can read about other possible time complexities [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity#Table_of_common_time_complexities).
